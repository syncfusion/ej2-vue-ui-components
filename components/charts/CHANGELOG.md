- **Legends**: Provide additional information about points in a customizable and interactive legend.
- **User interaction**: Add interactive features such as tooltips, rotation, tilt, data point highlight and selection.
- **Print and Export**: Print a 3D Circular Chart directly from the browser and export it in JPEG and PNG formats.
- **RTL**: The right-to-left mode aligns tooltips, legends, and data in the 3D Circular Chart component from right to left.
